# CS370-Pirate-Intelligent-Agent

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

- For this project we created an intelligent agent that traversed through a maze to get to the end. The agent would learn through Reinforcement Learning and eventually find the most efficient path through the maze. We were given two supporting files TreasureMaze.py, which represents the environment and includes a maze object defined as a matrix, and GameExperience.py, which stores the episodes. There was also some starting code in the main file that was given to us as well but the Q-training algorithm we had to create ourselves.

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

- A Computer Scientist is a very wide field of learning and many specialize in certain things within that field. The job of a computer scientist is to solve problems using technology. This can range from writting or editing software, applications, etc. They can even work in fields such as space exploration too. Almost everything that makes our daily life easier in terms of technology was done by computer scientists. 

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

- I approach problems analytically. First, I want to understand what I am being asked to do, then the software, or code, that I am working on, and then I try to find where and why the problem is occuring. I analyze the problem one step at a time and try to propose a solution to it. After I make a change I then test if that problem is solved. If not, I would go further into resolving the issue with another solution. Then test again. Essentially do so until the issue has been resolved. I found that there is a lot of trial and error and perseverence when it comes to writting code. Theres also many people who have run into the same issues as you, even if you aren't working on the same exact thing, so going to Google to try and find a solution is always a good idea because someone may have a different solution that you may not have considered. 

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

- I believe that my ethical responsbilities should always be in consideration to the end user and the organization. That also does not mean that if an organization asks me to do something unethical that I would. As computer scientists we understand more about the "fine print" of the internet and software. It is our moral obligation to protect our end users and our organization because without them we wouldn't have successful software, much less a job. What we create should always be formed with security and privacy as one of the most important aspects in our software. Keeping our end users and organization safe from risks is much more important than monetary gains.
